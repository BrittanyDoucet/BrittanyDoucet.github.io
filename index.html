<h2>Creating Your Own GitHub Portfolio</h2>
<p>You can create a GitHub Portfolio by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and Sign Up by creating a username and password</li>
<li>Click "Create Repository" and name it "yourusername.github.io". This will allow you to pull and access index.html files on the web from wherever you are.</li>
<li>Click "Upload Existing Files" and you can choose files or drag and drop them by opening their file location and dragging them onto the screen.</li>
<li>Once all your files are uploaded, click "Commit"</li>
<li>You can create an index.html by creating a new file, and entering the desired code, including one that will pull a profile picture (be sure the profile picture is located in the same place as the index.html)</li>
<li>Open a browser and navigate to your newly created GitHub account by entering "yourusername.github.io"</li>
</ol>
